# SQL Join and Subquery Exercises

This repository contains SQL queries designed to practice and demonstrate the use of JOINs and Subqueries. These exercises cover a range of complexity, from basic joins to more advanced subqueries, and are intended to help users improve their SQL skills.

## Contents

The repository includes a single document, `Join-Subquery Questions.pdf`, which outlines 50 SQL problems. The SQL queries that solve these problems are also included.

-   **`Join-Subquery Questions.pdf`**: This file contains the original questions covering various SQL JOIN and Subquery concepts. [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]
-   **SQL Queries**: The SQL queries that provide solutions to the problems presented in the PDF.

## Questions Overview

The questions are divided into two main categories:

* **Join Questions (1-25)**: These questions focus on using various types of JOINs (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and Self-Join) to retrieve data from multiple tables. They also cover aggregation, filtering, and other common SQL operations in conjunction with joins. [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
* **Subquery Questions (26-50)**: These questions focus on using Subqueries (both correlated and non-correlated) to retrieve data based on the results of other queries. They cover using subqueries in SELECT, FROM, WHERE clauses, and with operators like IN, EXISTS, and comparison operators. [cite: 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]

## How to Use

1.  **Download the Repository:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2.  **Review the Questions:** Open the `Join-Subquery Questions.pdf` file to see the SQL problems.
3.  **Execute the Queries:** Use your preferred SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite) to execute the provided SQL queries. Ensure you have the necessary database schema and data to run the queries.
4.  **Compare Results:** Analyze the results of the queries to understand how JOINs and Subqueries are used to solve different types of problems.

## Database Schema

To effectively use these queries, you'll need a database with tables that support the relationships implied in the questions (e.g., Customers, Orders, Employees, Departments, Products, etc.). The exact schema is not provided here, as the questions are designed to be adaptable to various database structures. However, the table and column names in the queries should give you a good indication of the required schema.
